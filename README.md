# Champagne Festival Website

This is the official website for the Champagne Festival, built with React and React Bootstrap.

> **IMPORTANT**: This project is currently being migrated from Next.js back to a standard React application. The `back-to-react` branch contains this migration work in progress.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

For Next.js implementation (legacy):
```bash
npm run dev
```

For React implementation (recommended):
```bash
npm run dev:react
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for Next.js or [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) for React with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - React application source code
  - `src/components/` - React components used throughout the application
  - `src/config/` - Configuration files for different aspects of the website
  - `src/translations/` - Translation files for i18n
  - `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `public/` - Static assets like images

> **Note**: The `app/` directory contains the previous Next.js implementation which is being phased out.

## Technologies Used

- React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React Bootstrap - UI component library
- i18next - Internationalization library for React applications
- TypeScript - Type-safe JavaScript

## Internationalization

The project is currently transitioning from Next.js with `next-intl` back to React with `i18next`. The new internationalization approach:

- Uses `i18next` and `react-i18next` for translations
- Implements browser language detection with `i18next-browser-languagedetector`
- Stores translations in JSON files in the `src/translations` directory
- Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translations in components

When developing, use the `useTranslation` hook from `react-i18next` to access translations:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  
  return <h1>{t('welcome.title', 'Welcome to Champagne Festival')}</h1>;
}
```

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow the established code style
2. Use React Bootstrap components for UI elements
3. Add translations for all user-facing text
4. Ensure mobile-first responsiveness
5. Add meaningful comments for complex logic

## Security Enhancements and Best Practices

### Image Handling

With the migration to React, we're using standard HTML `<img>` tags with the `ResponsiveImage` component for consistent image handling across the application.

```tsx
import ResponsiveImage from './components/ResponsiveImage';

<ResponsiveImage 
  src="/images/example.jpg" 
  alt="Example image" 
  width={800} 
  height={600} 
/>
```

### Contact Information Configuration

Contact information has been moved from hardcoded values in dictionary files to environment variables for improved security and easier updates:

1. Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
```
# Contact information
CONTACT_EMAIL=nancy.cattrysse@telenet.be
SENDER_EMAIL=nancy.cattrysse@telenet.be
INFO_EMAIL=nancy.cattrysse@telenet.be
MAIN_PHONE=+32478480177

# Social media handles
FACEBOOK_HANDLE=champagnefestival.kust

# Location information
VENUE_NAME=Meeting- en eventcentrum Staf Versluys
VENUE_ADDRESS=Kapelstraat 76
VENUE_CITY=Bredene
VENUE_POSTAL_CODE=8450
VENUE_COUNTRY=BelgiÃ«
VENUE_OPENING_HOURS=Zie programma
VENUE_LAT=51.23601
VENUE_LNG=2.97328

# Other configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://www.champagnefestival.be
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
```

2. Use the new components to display contact and location information from the configuration:
```tsx
// For contact information
import ContactInfo from "../components/ContactInfo";
<ContactInfo />

// For location information
import LocationInfo from "../components/LocationInfo";
<LocationInfo />

// For maps with coordinates from configuration
import MapComponent from "../components/MapComponent";
```

### Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive information
   - For local development, use `.env.local` (already in .gitignore)
   - For production, set environment variables in your hosting platform

2. **Image Sources**:
   - When adding new external image sources, ensure they're from trusted sources
   - Consider using content security policies to restrict image sources
   - Only add trusted and necessary image sources

3. **Contact Information**:
   - Update contact details by changing environment variables
   - Never hardcode contact information in source files or translations
   - Use the `ContactInfo` component for consistent display of contact information
   
4. **Event Schedule**:
   - Update the schedule in `src/config/schedule.ts` for upcoming events
   - The schedule is structured with festival days and events with detailed timing
   - For translations, update the event titles and descriptions in each language's dictionary file under `schedule.events`
   - Each event has an ID that's used to match translations in the dictionaries
## Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on Cloudflare Pages or any other static site hosting provider.

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production build in the `dist` directory that can be deployed to your preferred hosting provider.

Don't forget to set the required environment variables in your production environment.
