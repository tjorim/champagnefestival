# Champagne Festival - Simplified

This is a simplified version of the Champagne Festival website, using:

- Vite + React for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- i18next for translations
- Radix UI for theming
- Single page structure without complex routing

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Structure

- Simple App.tsx file contains all page content
- Components are reused from the original app
- Dark theme is applied by default
- No complex routing or context providers
